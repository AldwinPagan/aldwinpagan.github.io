[AppLivio](https://www.applivio.com/) is a platform for medical offices to increase their patient engagement through machine learning. The machine learning strategies are able to achieve over 85% of patient response and commitment to their appointments. Thanks to the machine learning strategies, it has been able to reduce the effort of manually confirming appointments from an average of 3 hours per day to minutes a week. My roles in this project included designing the platform's web and cloud infrastructure, and managing developers on-site and remotely.
